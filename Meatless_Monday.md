# 1-Pot Chickpea Tomato Peanut Stew (West African-Inspired)

## Ingredients

2 Tbsp coconut, olive, or avocado oil (if avoiding oil, sub water)  
1 medium red or white onion, diced   
1 large red bell pepper, diced (seeds and stems removed)   
6 cloves garlic, minced (6 cloves yield ~3 Tbsp or 18 g)   
1 large pinch sea salt   
2 14-ounce cans diced tomatoes   
1/2 cup tomato paste  
2-4 tsp chili garlic sauce (or sub cayenne to taste)  
1 cup natural, salted peanut or almond butter (creamy or chunky)   
2 cups light coconut milk  
2 15-ounce cans chickpeas, rinsed and drained   
2 cups water, depending on desired thickness   

## Instruction

1. Heat a large saucepan over medium heat. Once hot, add oil (or water), onion, red pepper, garlic, and a large pinch of salt. Cook for 3-5 minutes, stirring frequently or until peppers and onions are softened.  
2. Add the tomatoes (with their juices), tomato paste, chili garlic sauce, peanut butter, coconut milk, and (rinsed, drained) chickpeas. Stir to combine. Add water to desired thickness — about 2 cups (480 ml // as original recipe is written).  
3. Bring to a simmer, then lower heat, cover, and continue cooking until slightly thickened and fragrant — about 15-20 minutes. Turn the heat down if it's boiling — you're looking for a low simmer.  
4. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding salt to taste, additional peanut butter for depth of flavor and creaminess, chili garlic sauce for heat, or tomato paste for tomato flavor.  
5. Serve as a stew, over rice, or with naan or pita. For a lighter option, serve over cauliflower rice or a bed of raw or steamed broccoli (which happens to be our favorite). Basil and cilantro are delicious finishing touches.  
6. Store cooled leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop, adding more water or coconut milk to thin as needed.

# Spanish Tortilla

## ingredients

3 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided   
1 small onion, thinly sliced  
1 cup precooked diced red potatoes   
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme  
½ teaspoon smoked paprika  
6 large eggs  
4 large egg whites   
½ cup shredded Manchego, or Jack cheese   
3 cups baby spinach, roughly chopped  
½ teaspoon salt  
½ teaspoon freshly ground pepper   

## instruction

1. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring, until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes.  
2. Add potatoes, thyme and paprika and cook for 2 minutes more. Lightly whisk eggs and egg whites in a large bowl. Gently stir the potato mixture into the eggs along with cheese, spinach, salt and pepper until combined.  
3. Wipe the pan clean; add the remaining 1 teaspoon oil and heat over medium heat. Pour in the egg mixture, cover and cook until the edges are set and the bottom is browned, 4 to 5 minutes (it will still be moist in the center). To flip the tortilla, run a spatula gently around the edges to loosen them.   
4. Invert a large plate over the pan and turn out the tortilla onto it. Slide the tortilla back into the pan and continue cooking until completely set in the middle, 3 to 6 minutes.   

***Tips***

Store airtight in the refrigerator for up to 1 day.

Look for precooked diced potatoes in the refrigerated section of most supermarket produce departments.

# Mushroom Socca with Rosemary and Blistered Tomatoes
## ingredients
1 cup chickpea flour
1 cup water
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus additional for drizzling
1 tsp sea salt 
1 tsp finely minced rosemary
2-3 portobello mushrooms 
2 tsp balsamic vinegar
3 cups cherry tomatoes 
avocado oil (or other high-heat cooking oil)

## instructions
1. Combine the water, 2 tbsp olive oil, and 1 tsp sea salt in a medium bowl. Sift in 1 cup of chickpea flour and whisk the ingredients together, making sure no clumps remain. Cover and let the batter rest at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours or in the fridge overnight. 
2. In the meantime, prepare the portobellos: wipe the caps clean with a damp paper towel, remove the stems, and, with a small spoon, scrape out the black gills from the underside of the mushrooms. Chop the mushroom caps into 1/2-inch cubes or smaller.
3. Heat 1 tbsp avocado oil in a large pan over medium sized heat. Add the chopped mushrooms and saute on medium-high heat for a few minutes until the mushrooms release their moisture. Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue to saute until the mushrooms are cooked through. Season with sea salt and black pepper. Add the balsamic vinegar and increase the heat to medium-high. Continue to cook for another minute or two, stirring often, until most of the liquid in the pan has reduced. Remove from heat. 
4. Preheat the oven to 450 F and place a cast-iron skillet into the oven for a few minutes. Carefully add 1 tbsp of avocado oil (or other cooking oil) into the hot skillet and swirl it around to evenly coat the bottom. Add the batter to the pan and swirl it around to make sure the batter and the mushrooms are evenly distributed. Bake for about 15 minutes and then slide the pan under the broiler for another 3 to 5 minutes. 
5. Top the hot socca with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of sea salt. Allow the socca to cool for about 5 to 10 minutes in the pan. With a heat-proof spatula, gently loosen the edges. Slide the spatula under the pancake to make sure the bottom is completely loose from the pan and then slide it out onto a plate or a baking sheet. 
Serve!
*Leftovers can be stored in the fridge for a day or two but it's best to reheat before serving.*
***Tips***
1. add no more than 1 cup of cooked or raw veg.
2. can use other veggie such as other mushroom, tomatoes, spinach, zucchini, and onions

# Eggplant Lasagna Roll Ups
## Ingredients
2 medium eggplants (sliced into 12 1/4-inch slices lengthwise* // OR 12 lasagna noodles, boiled) 
**TOFU FILLING**
- 2 medium lemons, juiced 
- 1 12- ounce block extra-firm tofu (drained and pressed dry for 10 minutes) 
- 3 Tbsp nutritional yeast 
- 1/2 cup fresh basil (finely chopped) 
- 1 Tbsp dried oregano 
- 3-4 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil 
- ~1/2 tsp each salt + pepper 
- 1/4 cup vegan parmesan cheese (optional) 
**FOR SERVING**
- Vegan parmesan cheese 
- 2-3 cups favorite marinara/red sauce
- Fresh basil (optional // chopped) 
## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C).
2. Salt eggplant slices on both sides and arrange in a colander in the sink to remove excess water/bitterness for 15 minutes. (If using lasagna noodles, boil, drain and set aside.)
3. Rinse salted eggplant slices well and dry thoroughly between two clean absorbent towels. Lay a baking sheet on top and place something heavy on top to absorb excess moisture.
4. Arrange slices on 1-2 baking sheets in an even layer and bake oven for 13-15 minutes. Set aside and reduce heat to 375 degrees F (190 C).
5. While eggplant is baking, add all tofu filling ingredients to a food process or blender and pulse to combine, scraping down sides as needed. You are looking for a semi-pureed mixture with bits of basil still intact. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt and pepper for flavor, nutritional yeast for cheesiness, and lemon juice for brightness.
6. Pour about 1/2-1/3 of the marinara sauce into an 8x8 baking dish (or similar sized dish) and reserve rest of sauce for topping / serving. Set aside.
7. Scoop generous amounts (about 3 Tbsp) of ricotta filling onto each eggplant slice or lasagna noodle and roll up. Place seam side down in the sauce-lined baking dish. Continue until all filling and noodles or eggplant strips are used up. Pour more sauce down the center of the rolls for extra flavor (see photo).
8. Bake for 15-23 minutes, or until sauce is bubbly and warm and the top of the rolls are very slightly browned.
*Serve immediately with additional vegan parmesan cheese and fresh basil. Leftovers keep for a couple of days, though best when fresh.*
*2 lemons make ~1/3 cup juice*

# Vegan Eggplant Lasagna
## ingredients
**For the Lentil Filling**
1/2 Yellow Onion, diced
1 cup Carrot, finely diced
14 oz Crushed tomatoes
¼ cup Tomato Paste
1 cup Dry Green Lentils
2 cups Vegetable Broth 
½ cup Parsley, chopped
¼ cup Basil, chopped 
Salt, to taste
**For the Lasagna**
Lentil Filling, above
1 batch of Vegan Ricotta
3 large Eggplant, cut into ⅓” rounds
1 ½ cup Marinara Sauce of Choice
## Instruction
**Prepare the Eggplant**: Preheat the oven to 375F while you prepare all of the ingredients. Line 2-3 Baking Trays with parchment paper and fill each tray with the Eggplant “coins”, so none are overlapping. Bake for 25 minutes, then remove from the oven.
**Make the Lentil Filling**: In the meantime, add the diced Onion to a large pot with a splash of Water or Oil; sauté over Medium heat for 3-4 minutes, until translucent. Then, add the Carrot, Crushed Tomatoes, and Tomato Paste to the pot, stirring well. Once everything is well incorporated, add the Lentils, Vegetable Broth, Parsley, and Basil. Bring everything to a boil, then cover and simmer over low for 30 minutes.
**Layer the Lasagna**: Spread 1/2 cup of Marinara Sauce over the base of a large casserole dish, then cover it well with 1/3 of the Eggplant – try to overlap it as tightly as possible! 
Layer 1: spread 1/2 of the cooked Lentil filling evenly across the Eggplant, followed by 1/3 of the Vegan Ricotta
Layer 2: add another layer of Eggplant, then follow with the remainder of the Lentils and another 1/3 of the Ricotta
Top it Off: add the remainder of the Eggplant to the Casserole, followed by the rest of the Vegan Ricotta. Pour 1 cup of Marinara Sauce over the dish, and swirl it together with the Ricotta to complete the Lasagna.
**Bake and Serve**: bake the Lasagna at 375F for 35 minutes. Let the Lasagna sit for 10 minutes, then cut and serve as desired.
